                It's been a while since I posted, huh?
                
                <br><br>I'd like to share a bit about what I've been working on (or rather restarted working on) recently.

                <br><br> I've felt inspired lately as I have actually had the opportunity to talk about my game development on multiple occasions (interviews, social events).

                <br><br> I've wrapped up my sokoban game as far as I'd like to pursue it and it has been a great learning experience once again! I do although know it is another project that I haven't able to comercially release (sob).

                <br><br><br><span class="bolded">The Setup</span>

                <br><br>In my previous post about the prototype graveyard, I mentioned I started Unity by attempting to make my dream RPG game, which of course ended in overscoping and finding out my underdeveloped skills. Well this is that project, and I've devised a plan to complete it and focus on not overscope.
                
                <br><br>I'm definitely feeling a lot of my inner "idea person" coming out, so I'll need to be very careful going forward.

                <br><br>I've already imported a large portion of the salvagable code from the previous version. So really, this isn't the beginning, as I have months of code and notes for this project already.
                
                <br><br><br><span class="bolded">The Idea</span>

                <br><br>The 10000 foot view idea is to make a Paper Mario inspired turned based RPG. I'll simplify the work by making everything 2D and tile based for the overworld.
                
                <br><br>I've been 1000% doing that idea person thing, writting down notes about my game world constantly, slowly building up what the game is going to be. I'll of course need to be careful this doesn't lead to overscoping again.

                <br><br>The story is set in a slightly isolated nation, still recovering from a catastrophic weapon strike by a neighboring nation 20~ years beforehand.

                <br><br>It will follow a returning citizen looking for answers to what happened to his childhood friend and their potential connection to the catastrophe and a rumor of being able to reverse it all.
                
                <br><br>At the story progresses, the player party will expand to 5 characters, each dealing with themes surrounding how we as humans interact with the passing of time.
                
                <br><br>I've always imagined the game as 7 chapters, but it could very well be 6-8 chapters or maybe even more. These are the extreme brief versions of each chapter. I have a much more progressed version of the story written elsewhere, but thought it would be nice to finally publish even a summary of my ideas.

                <br><br>I have left things extremly vague as I'd need to explain the entire story to not...
                
                <br><br><br><span class="bolded">The Story Outline</span>
                <br><br>Chapter 1: A Stone's Throw Away
                <br><br>Set in the southern coastal town of Pebble's Perch, the journey begins with the unlikely friendship between a young prankster with a heart of gold and a washed up artist past his prime.
                <br><br>Theme: Fear of the Future and Growing Up

                <br><br><br>Chapter 2: What Lies in the Sand
                <br><br>The duo travel to the mysterious shifting desert and encounter a girl who claims to be from the past.
                <br><br>Theme: Memories and Self-Identity
                
                <br><br><br>Chapter 3: Reprise
                <br><br>The now trio take a detour through the nation's old capital, rescue a vigilante and discover a conspiracy that may tie each of their fates together.
                <br><br>Theme: Tradition and Change

                <br><br><br>Chapter 4: Home [Sic]
                <br><br>The artist dreams of his childhood, before the fall of the old nation. Although a dark secret hides within his rose-tinted memories.
                <br><br>Theme: Nostalgia, Regret

                <br><br><br>Chapter 5: Two Nights in Erem
                <br><br>The group arrives in the new capital, the business fueled, glowing paradise in the middle of a recovering land. The group all go their separate ways, but are slowly pulled together by seemingly coincidence. They acquire their last team member in the form of the bounty hunter that has been tracking them.
                    They must all come to terms with the fact their fates are tied together for better or worse and find out what is really happening to them.
                <br><br>Themes: Fate vs Chaos, Loneliness

                <br><br><br>Chapter 6: 
                <br><br>-> This is actually largely a placeholder for any extra content I want to add with the full party assembled.
                <br><br>Theme: 

                <br><br><br>Chapter 7: A Past Time
                <br><br>Our protagonists fight the one behind each of their perdicaments.
                <br><br>Theme: The Past's Relationship with the Present

                <br><br>I know this outine makes no sense to anyone but me, but I'd like to just put it out there!
                
                <br><br><br><span class="bolded">What I've Been Working on Now!</span>

                <br><br>What I would like to put out there though is just a very small amount of the design for the game I have layed out for chapter 1.

                <br><br>My art is far from good, but I feel it has been improving at a rapid rate!

                <br><br><br><span class="bolded">Other Things</span>

                <br><br>My music taste has been changing a bit again! Here are some highlight albums I've listened to recently:

                <br>Silent Alarm - Bloc Party (2005)
                <br>13 - Blur (1999)
                <br>ARDIPITHECUS - WILLOW (2015)
                <br>Keep It like a Secret - Built To Spill (1999)
                <br>Definitely Maybe - Oasis (1994)
                <br>Labcabincalifornia - Pharcyde (1995)

                <br><br>What has been really fun is learning some more songs on guitar too! I've been liking playing songs from Blur and Asian Kung Fu Generation recently!

                <br><br>I also took the Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator test on a whim a bit ago. It was very intersting how shockingly accurate the description of the type I was assigned was!
                (INTP). I do think it is important to be critical of the test as well though as although it borrows from established science and psychology principles, it is likely what would be classified a pseudoscience.
                I do think it holds much more weight to me than astrological signs though.

                <br><br>I was actully finding it very interesting that these kinds of things can actually be kind of true, but not in the way we expect! I think these notions of predertemined characteristics can set up self-fulfilling prophecies of sorts,
                as we might succumb to confirmation bias once we find out a set of characteristics we are "supposed to" fit. In other words, I might display the characteristics of the INTP group or a Gemeni just because I was told that is how I am!
                There is of course a danger to assigning people preconcieved notions, but I think if we treat things like astrology and the MB test as fun games, it can be enjoyable!

                <br><br><br><span class="bolded">Final Thoughts</span>
                <br><br>I think that will wrap up my post for today. I think I've mentioned it before, but I think I should keep this blog as just a way to vent out some of my thoughts. I do try to frame the posts as directed towards a reader, but really the posts just let me think about what I've been thinking about even more.

                <br><br>If there is someone out there reading these though, don't take this as any disuasion to reading them! It's just that blogging here has been much more enjoyable when not approaching it as a portfolio and more of a stream of conciousness with little pressure on scheduled posts.
