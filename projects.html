The site details my experience, projects, and contact information. I also developed a blog component, where I discuss my game development progress and personal interests. This was partitioned into a separate navigation bar due to its more casual nature.<br><br></p>

                <p class="description"><span class="info_Section_Text">GMTK Game Jam 2022 Submission: SIX (2022)</span><br>I had the opportunity to develop the game SIX, a short visual novel experience during my first game jam. The jam's theme was "Roll of the Dice". I chose to develop a short story about gambling, inspired by character driven narrative games. Although the game fell short of its grand aspirations, it was an invaluable experience for learning to prototype effectively under strict time constraints. The game was developed in Unity over the course of two days.<br><br></p>

                <p class="description"><span class="info_Section_Text">Steampunk Idle Prototype (2021)</span><br>As a part of my human-interaction course at Washington State University, I was tasked with designing a non-functional program model to implement and analyze UI/UX usability principles. As I was just beginning to learn Unity at the time, I chose to instead implement a working prototype of my group's Steampunk Idle Game concept. The game takes players through a short journey, where they battle pirates and buy ship upgrades.<br><br></p>

                <p class="description"><span class="info_Section_Text">Kaggle Profanity Detector (2021)</span><br>While taking a machine learning course, I and two other students developed an implementation of Naive Bayes Classifier to categorize profanity in online comments. We develpod the algorithm in Python and compared its effectivness to the Sci-kit learn built-in Bayes-Classifer function. We presented our findings in poster format at the end of the course.<br><br></p>
