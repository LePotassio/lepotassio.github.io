                    Today I’ll try out a section format as topics are pretty unrelated (See the end of the post for why it probably is a one-time thing).<br><br><br>


                    <span class="bolded">Game Dev</span> <br><br>
                    The scope of my project has been severely altered to fit a new type of end goal. Although I will retain my goal of a potential commercial release, I have decided to form the game in a way that will allow me to iterate sequentially, adding features on top of a game that could be called complete at any time. In past projects, I have found it incredibly difficult to keep my eye on the prize when iteration sprints are too long. In other words, having a game design that means I need to wait forever to get to the next “playable point” is just difficult to work with.<br><br>

                    My second Zelda prototype has for now eliminated the need for enemy AI for the time being and is much more puzzle leaning. My initial ideas were sparked from things like the boulder pushing puzzles in Pokemon Diamond and Pearl and the so-called “Sokoban” puzzle genre. My methodology is that if I start with a solid base, even if it has already been done before, I can then build on top of it in ways to make it unique. I of course should plan to some extent what some of these unique aspects should be, but I do not think they need to be 100% solid at this point.<br><br>

                    Coincidentally, a great little indie game with heavy Sokoban elements was released not too long ago. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1260520/Patricks_Parabox/">Patrick's Parabox</a> is a genius twist on the formula that uses recursive Sokoban boxes as its primary puzzle mechanic. I have not had the chance yet to play this game, but the gameplay seems utterly mind-bending and clever. I hope to be able to formulate unique elements such as this.<br><br>

                    I know it is also getting super ahead of myself, but I’ve been thinking about some of the aspects of marketing and game price point. Many of the channels I mentioned in the first game dev post are adamant that one should begin to create some type of advertisement early in the development process. I’ve been playing with the idea of releasing this project on either Itch.io or steam for no cost. I hear steam has an approximately $100 dollar fee for releasing on their platform. It would just be so awesome to release on steam even if it is for no profit. I suppose this does give off the impression that I am not confident in the profit-making potential of the game, and in this early stage, I somewhat am. However, moreover, I am just concerned about making sure I experience the full steps of releasing a game (although I do shutter a bit when I think about having to hire a lawyer for a small game release). In the end, I just want to release a cool game.<br><br>

                    I currently have a basic gird movement system with some simple changeable interactions between pushable and pullable objects as well as a level completion and warp system. I think it is a very good starting point for creating a simple yet elegant puzzle game. I’ll keep ya posted.<br><br>

                    I’m also very happy for Jonas Tyroller, as he released his steam game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1115050/Will_You_Snail/">Will You Snail?</a> recently!<br><br><br>

                    <span class="bolded">The Keyboard Rabbit Hole</span><br><br>
                    So yes, I have delved into the world of mechanical keyboards and subsequent customization. I’m definitely having a little bit of a “You were supposed to destroy the Sith, not join them” moment with this. Before getting my new keyboard, I was typing on a Logitech G213 membrane keyboard. This is still a great keyboard and I am using it on my separate gaming rig. However, in my current working area, I needed a smaller and more mobile keyboard. At the same time, I watched a video on others falling into the keyboard rabbit hole (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Yiz_VZD8sU">A Coffee Appears - Rob Gets Into Custom Keyboards?</a>). Initially, I scoffed at the seemingly bougie concept of a reduced custom keyboard.<br><br>

                    That soon changed. The need for the described mobile and small keyboard started turning cogs in my head about the prospect of a reduced keyboard. Function keys? When do I actually use those? TKL seems kinda like a good middle ground… Two or so hours later, I was shopping for a 60% keyboard.<br><br>

                    I will make a statement that I have not entered into the customization side of the keyboard rabbit hole. It is actually for that exact reason that my final decision was on the (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/ANNE-PRO-Wireless-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B07Y53G7B6?th=1">Anne Pro II 60% Mechanical Keyboard</a>). I do have a soft spot for minimalism and thought I could spoil myself a little bit instead of going for one of the cheaper clones. I did have to replace some of the keys to get back dedicated arrow keys, but after that, I have been thoroughly enjoying this new keyboard. Oh no, it may not be long before I start referring to keyboards as “Keebs”.<br><br>

                    I totally understand if there may be a bit of eye-rolling going on for some readers. I would have definitely done the same. But man, this keyboard is nice (and it has lights).<br><br><br>

                    <span class="bolded">1999 Albums</span><br><br>
                    Before I started listening to music on streaming services, I used to buy albums from a local Best Buy. That got me to really listen through each album thoroughly. However, listening to streaming services has made me switch to listening to the most popular tracks for artists.<br><br>

                    I’m trying now to go through an album here and there instead of listening to the same songs on repeat, partially to expand my music pool and partially because my discovery of new music has become slow of late. Out of a little bit of curiosity and misplaced self-importance, I’ve been focusing on albums that were released in my birth year of 1999.<br><br>

                    Although I initially began with full reviews of each album, I’ve decided to just list and point out highlights.<br><br>
                    Here’s what I have listened to recently.<br><br>

                    The Wall - Pink Floyd (1979)<br>
                    Dawn FM - The Weeknd (2022)<br>
                    Twilight- boa (2001)<br>
                    2001 - Dr. Dre (1999)<br>
                    The Soft Bulletin - The Flaming Lips (1999)<br>
                    There Is Nothing Left To Lose - Foo Fighters (1999)<br>
                    So…How’s Your Girl? - Handsome Boy Modeling School (1999)<br>
                    Make Yourself - Incubus (1999)<br>

                    <br><br>

                    I generally enjoyed all the albums.<br><br>

                    I’ve been meaning to listen to The Wall for a while and loved the seamless transitions like in The Dark Side of the Moon (1973).<br><br>

                    I think Race for the Prize on The Soft Bulletin will be a song I listen to very consistently.<br><br>

                    There Is Nothing Left To Lose is a solid album. R.I.P Taylor Hawkins.<br><br><br>


                    <span class="bolded">Blog Stuff</span><br><br>

                    Still trying to find a good way to time these posts! I kinda thought that I would post whenever I feel like it but I’ve been kind of feeling a little obligated to post on a somewhat regular basis. I kind of want to avoid having the blog take up too much time I could be doing game dev, playing games, talking with friends, or in general doing life stuff. I may try to keep posting to either very short snippets when I want to post about something immediately in sectioned webpages and keep large posts to monthly or bi-monthly.<br><br>

                    I’ll probably stop linking like every single thing I mention too as it is a bit of effort to do so. People have Google for a reason!<br><br>

                    So this will likely be the unicorn post of a large sectioned post unless I decide otherwise For example, this post would likely be 4 separate posts with much more time in between posting. I do realize maybe I’m feeling pressure to fill out the blog’s content as it was empty not long ago. But keeping it at a pace that doesn’t make me burn out or become lazy will be what fills it out in the long run!
