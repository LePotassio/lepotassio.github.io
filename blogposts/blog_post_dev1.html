                I mention multiple YouTube channels in the following post.<br><br>
                If you own one of the channels mentioned and would like your channel to not be mentioned, please contact me and let me know so that I can remove it!<br><br><br>
                It's time to get down to business. The previous post was really my cheesy hopes and ambitions post to kick off the blog. In this post, I'll attempt to catch up my zero readers on my game development progress.<br><br>
                *Record scratch* Let's rewind back just under two years ago. My college had just recently switched to remote learning due to the pandemic, I was seeking to fill a cliché hole in my heart after a study abroad experience I was fortunate enough to participate in, and my creative/coding itch was rapidly turning into a rash. What better to do than download the Unity game engine and try to make a game? It is “free” after all!<br><br>
                Well here I am approaching the two year anniversary of this decision. What have I accomplished so far?<br><br>
                My first exploration into the Unity engine took just about the worst approach possible (Disclaimer: I had done a couple of very simple projects in Unity years prior). I opened up Unity3D, searched Unity beginner tutorials, watched a good chunk of video on the Brackeys YouTube channel (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Brackeys">see here</a>), and then proceeded to try to code a JRPG inspired masterpiece. This lack of planning and over estimation of ability would spell a quick doom for my first game attempt. But I was learning…<br><br>
                I would then move on to making a few simple, albeit still overly ambitious (for my skill level) game prototypes. I became fascinated with videos from the channel Sebastian Lague, who explores extremely interesting coding concepts in the lens of game development (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague">see here</a>). At the same time, I happened upon Thomas Brush's YouTube channel which provides insight into the solo development experience (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AtmosGames">see here</a>). Game Maker's Toolkit was also a powerhouse of curiosity fuel for me to get excited about making my game (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MarkBrownGMT">see here</a>). Now instead of taking in just video game content, I was also absorbing game development knowledge.<br><br>
                So of course the only logical thing I could do is just start over my initial project with all the knowledge I had learned, right? Nothing could possibly go awry. Well it turns out, no matter how determined you might be, a couple of YouTube videos and some janky prototype game experiments will not instantly enable you to create an RPG that would typically be created by a small team of experienced game devs.<br><br>
                I did make some steps in the right direction though. First off, I made the decision to switch to Unity2D as a “first game” in my mind would not need the added complications of 3D space. 2D would also constrain my requirements a bit, so that I would not bite of more than I could chew (although I still did). Secondly, I took the time to learn some of the basics of digital art so that I could truly make the game my own. Around this time, I had discovered through Thomas Brush, another YouTube Channel called Game Dev Unlocked (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GameDevUnlocked">see here</a>). The channel's owner, David always stressed the importance of finishing a game and taking shortcuts when necessary. One of these shortcuts is to use store bought assets. However, I believe making my own art will need to be one of the selling points of my game to give off the “indie game appeal”. With that said though, David's channel really got me thinking about the enormous scope of my game.<br><br>
                Let's place a quick timestamp. Now it's already been about a year and a half of developing games, finishing college and reviewing interview material (about half a year ago from the writing of this). I'm pretty familiar with the workings of Unity and have the base of a game that would take me about 4 more years to complete as a solo dev. Yeah, like 4 years. Something needed to change and the culprit seemed to be scope, or the proverbial mountain that needs to be climbed mentioned in David's videos.<br><br>
                I was also reading on Derek Yu's (the creator of Spelunky) website and tumbler on making games as I was recommended by a Reddit post on game development progress. This is where I found what might have been some of the most obvious in hindsight, yet most important tips for my game dev experience (It's also partially what inspired me to make this website!) (<a href="https://www.derekyu.com/">see here</a>) and (<a href="https://makegames.tumblr.com/post/1136623767/finishing-a-game">here</a>). It first rehashes David's sentiment. Goal number one is to FINISH YOUR GAME. It also recommended minimizing starting over as to avoid the loop of learning and restarting. Finally, it really called me out by making a game developer trope definition for “The Daydreamer”. God, when I read this description I knew it was me. In short, I need to keep my skills in mind when I design games and not just get lost in text documents, dreaming about how awesome the game I'm going to make will be. I even have all the characters and fantasy world in my head that it talks about! I will not become a dreaded “Idea Person” (<a href="https://www.derekyu.com/makegames/archetypes.html#daydreamer">see here</a>).<br><br>
                Will all of this said, I did still need to hit that reset button one more time despite Derek's warning. I just couldn't afford to slowly chip away at a project I had made so large that it would take me several years of full time work.<br><br>
                I had to go back to the drawing board (partially as I do want to carry the good ideas over). The scope needed to be shrunk down by a huge factor. Instead of an RPG, I decided to focus on a classic Zelda like game. My idea is actually inspired more by the game Minit. I'm hoping that if I can execute a well-known idea in a polished fashion, while also adding my unique spin, I will be able to create a great game within my skill set. I'll hopefully provide more details on this game in subsequent posts!<br><br><br>
                I'll need to remain vigilant as to not let scope creep and my other daydreamer habits take over my game. Work will need to be consistent but also scheduled in a way that doesn't drive me crazy. Then maybe I'll be able to look back on posts like this and reflect on what I've learned from releasing a game.<br><br>
                And of course, I need to remember the key to game dev: RELEASE. YOUR. GAME.<br><br>
                Turns out making games is hard! I suppose the journey has only just begun...
