                Another month and a half has already passed! I've been quite busy between job applications, game dev, and practicing guitar.<br>

                Ugly UI warning! You have been warned!<br><br>

                My game dev progress has been a little bit slower than I would like (of course). Progress has at least been fairly consistent of late. I try to make sure I accomplish progress in some of my other
                goals like job searching beforehand. I had a conversation recently that actually pointed out a fatal mistake I may be making and that's to document my progress! I'll try to post at least some
                images to go along with my progress.<br><br>

                I have some base mechanics down, with a system in place to allow me to add puzzle elements with configurable interactions between them all. For example, I could make a rock that pushes pebbles,
                but not boulders.<br><br>

                I also have some very ugly, but usable UI that I can build off of. My most recent step was adding in a main menu, pause menu, and binary serializer for saving the game. I am currently spinning
                my wheels on deciding when and how progress should be saved (savepoint, after puzzle completion, via main menu, when the game exits).

                I guess it has been kind of bugging me how my game is going to be different from other similar games. I'm not sure if I should be worried about that at this stage or ever for this specific game given the fact
                I have not yet released a commercial game.<br><br>

                I've also decided to aim to participate in the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022">2022 GMTK Game Jam</a>. I've felt very apprehensive to do any game jams as I tend to doubt my skills
                especially in situations with a lot of pressure. I think it may be best to bite the bullet, or rather jump into the cold pool and just do one. I have been working in Unity for a little over
                two years after all.<br><br>

                Just before posting I saw the video David Wehle posted on his departure from Youtube. Although I am of course sad that there will not be more Game Dev Unlocked videos for the forseable future,
                I am glad he is putting priority on his own well being. That should always come first! I hope maybe if he ever feels comfortable doing so, if he could drop just a life/game dev update
                every once in a while. I'll alwyas return to his videos
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh0F9m1O4gk">The #1 Miskate New Indie Devs Make</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoG-uwWaJJM&t=19s">How I Finished My Indie Game (Even When I Hated It)</a>.
                I hold those videos very dear to me.<br><br>
                Best of luck to you, David.<br><br><br>

                Something Has just really clicked with me recently when it comes to guitar. The weirdest thing was, I was distracting myself from game dev by trying to finally sit down and learn a fighting game.
                I ended up trying to really dig into the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/245170/Skullgirls_2nd_Encore/">Skullgirls</a>. The game is great, but I had this moment where I was like
                "I'm memorizing all these crazy combos, it's almost like I'm playing an instrument" (This could have been emphasized by the character <a href="https://skullgirls.fandom.com/wiki/Big_Band">Big Band</a>).
                So naturally, I was like "Why don't I just learn to play guitar if I'm gonna memorize a 20 step looping combo".<br><br>

                Well I got my very under used electric guitar re-setup and I guess the rest is history.
                I've been playing a ton of songs by Interpol and Asian Kung Fu Generation.<br><br>

                That brings me to my next point, the full albums I've listened to.<br><br>

                Turn On The Bright Lights - Interpol (2002)<br>
                Antics - Interpol (2004)<br>
                Our Love To Admire - Interpol (2007)<br>
                In Utero - Nirvana (1993)<br>
                Violent Femmes - Violent Femmes (1983)<br>
                Humbug - Arctic Monkeys (2009)<br>
